      "The laptop is made out of metal and glass, no plastic to see anywhere, the touch pad is glass and it's Huge and responsive. The keyboard is good with three stages of backlit brightness.The pros: excellent display brightness and clarity, the resolution of this display on a 14 inch screen makes it crisp and clear. Since its an amoled display and pantone validated the colour accuracy out of the box is awsome.Display is glossy but at med to max brightness indoors the glare and reflections are under control nothing to worry about there.The speakers are excellent don't fall for the bad speaker reviews, the speakers are low sounding out of the box, as the guy in other review mentioned just turn on the dynamic mode in Dolby app and turn on volume boost in my asus app, they get loud and the sourround sound is excellent for the movies and any other content you might watch. Don't except a huge amount of bass though, the bass is just there you can notice it, but the surround sound with mids and lows will cover up for that anyways. The speakers are downfiring and doesnt feel that way with atmos enabled. The sound can easily fill up midsized room when the laptop is sitting on desk while in lap the sound is enough for one person to enjoy even with a relatively loud surrounding area.The professor and Ram are fine and fast, using intensive tasks such as photo editing and casual gaming can best done with ac power connected, while on battery its best to be used an ultrabook for office tasks and using it to study if you're a student to take classes in power saver mode will give you six to eight hours of battery life.I dont see any cons since I dont care about it heating a bit while sitting on a table, when I use it on lap I just use it for content consumption rather than for heavy tasks, after all this a slim laptop so heating over a period of lengthy tasks is to be expected with an Intel processor In it, the lucky part is that atleast it had two fans to cool unlike the new zenbook laptops.I dont use the webacam anyways so, I dont care about it personally but its there, its 720p for those who want to know.\n",

      "Ok so ill get into it quick, ordered the laptop for rupees seven 1 triple nine and also hdfc discount of five k .now coming to the laptopPros (in order of priorities) :1.  Screen ( 10/10)Brilliant display . its just amazing  2.8k with oled .one  of the main reasons i bought it.  see heres the thing. the only part in your pc that you will be using to 100% , not the CPU not the ram not the ssd. its the display. you will always be viewing it all the time. Andi was very particular on having a good display as i would be staring at it for 6-8hrs everyday.Oleds are amazing, you cant go back once you start using it.its amazing for me as i can go dark mode for majority of applications and it significantly reduces the strain on my eyesVsCode is just lovely on dark mode, it goes fully black with this screen so no strain whatsoever.Also the 16:10 aspect ratio really helps, more vertical screen space. while still portable like a regular 14incher2. Build (10/10)its a neat metalic build , with good craftmenship and design. Looks very premium .built sturdy as well.this was important to me as i will be travelling often now and want something that i know i can trust.btw if your considering between Zenbook and Vivobook with same specs, i would highly suggest a zenbook even if with a slightly higher price differnce. Have used vivobook k513 oled for 1.5 yrs. while everything was good. the build quality always scared me.knew it would break if not taken care properly. Also the screen got some internal uncleanable stains after 3months.Whatever money your trying to save youll make it back when reselling the laptop anyways.3. Performance ( i5-12500H , 16gb LPDDR5X , 512gb pcie 4 ssd, )The Processor:An absolute beast, can handle anything. Has a geekbench score of 10544. it even beats the 11th generation i9also friendly tip:  Whenever looking for a laptop, dont just go on the i3 vs i5 vs i7 vs i9 . and think if the number after \" i \" is bigger it would be a better processor.This is not true and big misconception in general public .the more important thing to see is the generation. this pc is a good example . it has i5 12th gen but i5 12t h gen is more powerful than even i9 of 11th gen.yes if the generation is same then defenitily you can follow the i3 > i5> i7> i9. But even then value for money caps out at i5. You would not be getting significantly more powerful pc after i5 .  just slight incrementsGPU:it has an integrated graphics card. Can be used for light casual gaming .Its more than good enough for something  time to time.Obviously if your looking for something just for gaming , want to play latest AAA titles you already know this is not for you.RAM and SSD:Top notch, but feel that a 32gb option or an upgradable slot should have been given.As more number of cores = more ram consumedOther positives:- The speakers are loud enough and good clarity, has dolby atmos.- So the charger is type C and adaptive with 15W 27W 45W and 100W  .  Quick charging for laptop and also very helpful while travelling as you will not need to carry 2 chargers always and can charge your phone , earphones too-  the fingerprint scanner is embedded in the power button, gives a very smooth experience when turning on. just click the button and it turns on. no need of again giving the finger print once in lock screen- so generally you will not get numpad with 14inch laptops, but this has a touch numpad, personally not so useful for me . but good attempt by the company never the less.Negatives:Honestly for the price i bought it , its very good. no issues. im not one of those people that are never satisfied no matter what, comparing with laptop with 2x 3x of the the price or making wrong claims or having unreasonable expectationssaw a review here complaining why there was no dedicated gpu and he was dissatisfied because of it...ok broalso another guy saying that the touch numpad is not good and he was expecting a on keyboard one and hence was disappointed( bro in 14inch ultrabooks nobody gives a onkeyboard numpad because of size, the touch numpad they gave was just a bonus. well and good if useful but i dont see whats the point of complaining )- another guy saying that he was disappointed because in oled you always need to use darkmode. This is not true btw. and bro you should have researched a bit before buying right.but if i had to point something out , again very minor or solvable issues1. so the fan is on the right side , so if you have a habit of using a mouse, the hot air will blow directly to your hand .2. only 1 USB Type A slot. so you will not be able simultaneously plug in a mouse and keyboard or a pendrive lets say.but again im just being too picky over here.  easily solvable with using a converter on the type c ports. and anyhow i think now the world is moving towards type c ports itself. and should be standard with everything moving forwardConclusion:Again if you can get it for the price i mentioned on top, and the points in my review make sense to you , you can go for it.############EDIT: 4 Month updateNo issues so far, laptop working the same..one more pointscreen is a glossy so problamtic in sunny areas . but i think all oleds do come with glossy itself for some reason\n",

      "The product is superb. But know that the amd version of these are available in flipkart, and that may be better than this in battery life.This laptop is extremely powerfull, but since it is a compact laptop, there is heating issues.Battery life is now around 3 hours. Initially it was around 1 hr. Battery life stabilizes only after a week or so.There is coil whine sound from my laptop, but when i visited asus service, they told that it will not harm the device.The display is great. Look of product is great.But if you need battery and you are not going to do intense tasks, you better go for other processors of zenbook.note: If you are opting for an exchange, know that the exchange amount will not be credited to your bank account if you return this item. It will be credited as Amazon pay balance, which is of not much use.I opted for a replacement since there was coil whine sound, but amazon told me that there will be no replacement but only return. Since my exchange amount will only be credited in amazon pay, I settled with the given product after consulting asus service centre.I think going with flipkart will be a much better idea, since their models are somewhat superior.After purchasing any asus laptop, go to asuspromo.in site and there is huge discount in purchasing extended warranty. In my research, the extended warranty option of amazon and flipkart are not dependable.Apart from all these, the laptop is snappy and the display is just amazing.edit: Recently i came to know about temporarily disabling extra cores of this cpu when not in use. If you are doing only browsing and movie watching then by disabling extra cores, you can get around 5+ hrs of battery life. you can disable the cores in device manager. Watch any youtube video before doing this.\n",

      "I bought the Zenbook 14 OLED during the Diwali sale and have had it for 3 weeks now. I moved from using a MacBook Pro 14\" (had to return it to my previous employer) to this as a daily laptop, and I will compare the two.Pros:- Phenomenal screen quality: the OLED display + 2.8k resolution + 90Hz refresh is simply too good. No Mac screen comes close to this. You will have trouble moving back to another laptop once you get used to this - the display is very easy on the eye.- Metal case: build quality is good (although still a notch below the Macbook Pro or Air) and there is no screen flex. I got the black finish and it isn't much of a smudge magnet- Keyboard & trackpad: full size backlit keyboard with good travel. The trackpad is large and easy to use (although not with the glass finish you get in the Macbook)- Sound: no complaints; comes with built-in Harman Kardon speakers- Value for money: with this screen size & resolution, the 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD and the bundled Office 365 subscription, I couldn't find anything even close to this. I had some apprehensions about the build quality, but those proved to be unfounded after using the laptop - it looks and feels premium.Cons:- Battery life: not a deal breaker as it lasts me 5 hours (normal browsing + taking notes). But I am running it at full 2.8k and 90Hz refresh - I'm sure the battery will last much longer if I bring the refresh rate down to 60Hz like all normal laptops (Mac or otherwise).- If the laptop goes into a \"hard\" sleep (4 hours or more), it takes up to 20 seconds to login and be fully running again - my Macbook was superior in this regard. Again, this can be adjusted in the system settings\n",

      "On 10/3/2024, I bought an ASUS ZenBook 14X OLED laptop, which was delivered on 13/3/24. Upon unboxing it on the 14th, I charged it and started using it. However, within two hours, I encountered overheating issues, and the battery only lasted 3 to 4 hours for basic tasks. Additionally, I noticed the adapter was heating excessively. When I contacted Amazon customer service, they directed me to register the complaint with ASUS. Despite calling ASUS on Tuesday, they insisted I visit their service center, but couldn't accommodate me until Wednesday. Despite assurances from customer service, the service center refused to replace the laptop, citing their replacement policy. They only offered repairs, leaving me feeling frustrated with wasted money and time. The issues with the laptop include overheating, excessive adapter heating, a battery health of 98%, and a count  2, Battery 3 to 4hrs.\n",

      "I just purchased it few days back! It's just amazing 😍😍. The best is the display it's just wow the display looks just awesome! It has i5 12th generation processor which is super fast and gen4 ssd 512gb and 16gb Lpddr 5 ram and inbuilt intel iris Xe graphics card! Which is super amazing 😍😍😍😍. I really love this product in terms of battery life i didn't tested that much with power mode i usually use it with the charging so can't easily talk about it! But i know it's amazing. Speaker quality is really impressive really very loud if you turn on the dynamic audio mode it's just wow!The display is oled and 16:10 aspect ratio 2.8k resolution you will definitely feel it the vibrance of the display and the quality. Just turn on the display and you will get understand the superb quality it feels really awesome in the eye! And the main part is weight and form factor which i like the most because really light weight and form factor is really awesome! Backlight has 3 mode in the keyboard! So you can easily type at night no issues i personally use it a lot! And the cooling fan is really very nice! Easily heat can transfer!\n",

      "The Asus ZenBook 14X OLED is an impressive laptop with a sleek design and excellent build quality. It boasts a decent 5-6 hours of battery life in power-saving mode, and its Cinebench r23 score reaches a notable 10800.However, it's important to note that the slim design can lead to the laptop getting warm, and the fans might become noisy when operating at high performance (max fan RPM is around 7800 RPM). Despite these considerations, the laptop's aesthetics are enhanced by its thin bezels, creating an attractive overall package.The real showstopper is the OLED display, which is truly exceptional. To experience its brilliance, you're encouraged to visit a nearby mall or showroom.On the downside, the speakers, while loud, lack clarity. The webcam and speakers might be considered subpar, falling short of expectations. Comparatively, even a smartphone's speakers may provide a clearer and better audio experience.For those on a budget of 60,000, the S14/S15 OLED is an alternative, offering similar specifications but with a plastic build. In conclusion, the Asus ZenBook 14X OLED is a good choice, delivering excellent build quality, a stunning display, and ample power. To gain a comprehensive perspective, it's advisable to explore other reviews as well.\n",
